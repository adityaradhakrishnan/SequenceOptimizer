# Sequence Optimizer

A small (but getting bigger!) Python script that takes a gene and changes codon usage to "optimize" or "de-optimize" protein expression. This is done through usage of a reference "optimal genome." This is a user-provided FASTA file which contains the DNA sequences of the most highly expressed genes in that species/cell line. Just select a region, a target optimality, and let it rip!
